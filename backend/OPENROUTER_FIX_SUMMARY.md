# OpenRouter Tool Calling Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The original error was:
```
Error code: 404 - {'error': {'message': 'No endpoints found that support tool use. To learn more about provider routing, visit: https://openrouter.ai/docs/provider-routing', 'code': 404}}
```

## Root Causes

1. **Wrong Default Model**: The original implementation used `google/gemma-3-27b-it:free` as the default model, which doesn't support tool calling
2. **Improper OpenRouter Configuration**: The ChatOpenAI class wasn't configured specifically for OpenRouter's API requirements
3. **Outdated LangChain Packages**: Using older versions that might not have the latest OpenRouter compatibility improvements
4. **No Tool Support Filtering**: The model list included many models that don't support tool use

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Custom ChatOpenRouter Class

Created a new `ChatOpenRouter` class that extends `ChatOpenAI` with OpenRouter-specific configuration:
- Proper API key handling with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- Automatic base URL setting to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
- OpenRouter attribution headers (`HTTP-Referer`, `X-Title`)
- Proper LangChain secrets configuration

### 2. Updated Default Model to Tool-Compatible Option

Changed the default model from `google/gemma-3-27b-it:free` to `anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku`:
- Excellent tool calling support
- Cost-effective
- High performance
- Reliable availability

### 3. Filtered Model List for Tool Compatibility

Updated `list_models()` to only include models that support tool calling:
- Anthropic Claude models (3.5 Sonnet, 3.5 Haiku, etc.)
- OpenAI GPT models (GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, etc.)
- Google Gemini models (Pro 1.5, Flash 1.5, etc.)
- Meta Llama models (3.1 series)
- Mistral models (Large, Mixtral series)
- Cohere Command models
- Selected free models that support tools

### 4. Enhanced Health Checks

Added `tool_calling_supported` flag to health check responses to help with debugging.

### 5. Updated LangChain Dependencies

Upgraded to latest versions:
- `langchain-core==0.3.18`
- `langchain==0.3.20`
- `langchain-openai==0.3.7`
- Added `python-dotenv==1.0.1`

## Files Modified

1. **models/providers/openrouter_provider.py**: Complete rewrite with new ChatOpenRouter class
2. **requirements.txt**: Updated LangChain package versions

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Install/Upgrade Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt
   # or if using virtual environment:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
   ```

3. **Restart Application**: The new configuration will be loaded automatically.

## Verification

The fix has been verified to:
- ✅ Create proper ChatOpenRouter class with OpenRouter configuration
- ✅ Use tool-compatible default model (anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku)
- ✅ Filter model list to only include tool-compatible models
- ✅ Add tool_calling_supported flag to health checks
- ✅ Update LangChain packages to latest versions

## Technical Details

### Why This Fix Works

1. **Tool Compatibility**: By switching to `anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku`, we ensure the default model supports OpenAI-compatible tool calling
2. **Proper API Configuration**: The ChatOpenRouter class handles OpenRouter's specific API requirements
3. **Latest LangChain Features**: Updated packages include improvements for OpenRouter compatibility
4. **Better Error Handling**: Health checks now indicate tool calling support status

### Models That Support Tool Calling on OpenRouter

The fix ensures only these verified tool-compatible models are used:
- All Anthropic Claude 3+ models
- All OpenAI GPT-4+ and GPT-3.5+ models
- Google Gemini Pro/Flash 1.5+ models
- Meta Llama 3.1+ models
- Mistral Large and Mixtral models
- Cohere Command models

## Community LangChain Packages

Note: There is no official `langchain-community` package specifically for OpenRouter. The fix uses the standard `langchain-openai` package with proper OpenRouter configuration, which is the recommended approach according to the [OpenRouter documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/frameworks#using-langchain).
